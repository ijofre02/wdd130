        <p>Hi, my name is Jofré Ignacio, and I'm from San Luis, Argentina. I love cold weather, and I was blessed to
            serve the Lord
            in the Comodoro Rivadavia mission. I'm currently studying software development through BYU Pathway because I
            believe
            technology can make life easier. I'm also passionate about science—I study chemistry as a hobby, and I
            worked for a year
            as a data analyst at a factory. I'm excited to begin this new journey and bring together everything I've
            learned along
            the way. </p>
